# UFOs

# Overview
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The original webpage that was created only provided users with a date filter. However, for this project, we want to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

The reults of the new webpage is that it will be very easier to see UFO sightings for aspecific city or country or state even the shape of the sighting.
The images below show the perfect created webpage:

# Summary
One drawback is I believe the images that people have taken for the UFO sightings can be included to provide a better insight to the data as well as an addition would be to let users modify the webpage just like a wikipedia page in order to have more and more sightings people have witnessed which can be addressed in the webpage.
